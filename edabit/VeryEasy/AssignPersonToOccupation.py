"""
You have two lists. One shows the names of the people names,
while the other shows their occupation jobs.
Your task is to create a dictionary displaying each person
to their respective occupation.

Person	Job
Annie	Teacher
Steven	Engineer
Lisa	Doctor
Osman	Cashier
Example
names = ["Dennis", "Vera", "Mabel", "Annette", "Sussan"]
jobs = ["Butcher", "Programmer", "Doctor", "Teacher", "Lecturer"]

assign_person_to_job(names, jobs) âžž {
  "Dennis": "Butcher",
  "Vera": "Programmer",
  "Mabel": "Doctor",
  "Annette": "Teacher",
  "Sussan": "Lecturer"
}

Notes
* The two lists have the same length.
* The index of a name in the names list is the same as the index of
the person's job in the jobs list, as shown in the table above.
* Check Resources for some useful information that can help with this
challenge.
